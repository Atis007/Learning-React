- **Player Name Management**: Editable player names with ref-based input handling
- **Modal System**: Result modals using React Portals
- **Timer Management**: Precise timer controls with useRef for mutable values
- **Score Calculation**: Performance scoring based on timing accuracy
- **Interactive UI**: Real-time feedback and smooth user interactions
- **Multiple Challenges**: Various difficulty levels (1s, 5s, 10s, 15s)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Framework**: React 19 with modern hooks
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **Styling**: CSS with component-scoped styling
- **Development**: ESLint for code quality

## 🎓 React Concepts You Can Learn

This project is excellent for mastering advanced React patterns and DOM manipulation:

### 🔗 React Refs Deep Dive
- **useRef Hook**: Creating mutable references that persist across renders
- **DOM References**: Direct DOM element access and manipulation
- **Input Refs**: Managing focus, selection, and input values imperatively
- **Timer Refs**: Storing mutable values like timers and intervals
- **Ref vs State**: Understanding when to use refs instead of state

### 🌊 React Portals
- **Portal Concepts**: Rendering components outside the parent DOM hierarchy
- **Modal Implementation**: Creating overlays and modal dialogs with portals
- **DOM Hierarchy**: Breaking out of component tree constraints
- **Event Bubbling**: Understanding event behavior with portals
- **Use Cases**: When and why to use portals in applications

### ⏰ Timer & Lifecycle Management
- **useRef for Timers**: Storing timer IDs without causing re-renders
- **setTimeout Management**: Starting, stopping, and clearing timeouts
- **Component Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of timers and intervals
- **Side Effects**: Managing side effects with useEffect
- **Memory Leaks Prevention**: Avoiding common pitfalls with timers

### 🎮 Game Logic & State Management
- **Game State**: Managing complex game state and user interactions
- **Performance Calculation**: Computing scores and results
- **User Input Handling**: Capturing and processing user interactions
- **State Synchronization**: Coordinating multiple state updates
- **Conditional Logic**: Game rules and win/lose conditions

### 🏗️ Advanced Component Patterns
- **Imperative APIs**: When to break React's declarative model
- **Forward Refs**: Passing refs through component boundaries (if implemented)
- **Compound Components**: Building complex component relationships
- **Render Props**: Flexible component composition patterns
- **Custom Hooks**: Extracting reusable stateful logic

### 🎯 Performance & Optimization
- **Avoiding Re-renders**: Using refs for values that don't need re-renders
- **DOM Performance**: Direct DOM manipulation when appropriate
- **Event Optimization**: Efficient event handling patterns
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and garbage collection

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Set Your Name**: Click on the player name to edit it
2. **Choose Difficulty**: Select from Easy (1s) to Pros only (15s)
3. **Start Timer**: Click "Start Challenge" to begin the countdown
4. **Stop Timer**: Try to stop as close to the target time as possible
5. **View Results**: See your score in the modal that appears

## 💡 Key Code Examples

### Using Refs for DOM Access
```javascript
const playerName = useRef();

const handleClick = () => {
  playerName.current.focus();
  playerName.current.select();
}
```

### Timer Management with Refs
```javascript
const timer = useRef();

const handleStart = () => {
  timer.current = setTimeout(() => {
    // Timer expired
  }, targetTime * 1000);
}

const handleStop = () => {
  clearTimeout(timer.current);
}
```

### Using Portals for Modals
```javascript
import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';

return createPortal(
  <div className="modal">
    {/* Modal content */}
  </div>,
  document.getElementById('modal-root')
);
```
