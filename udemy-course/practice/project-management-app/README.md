# Practice: Project Management App 📋

A hands-on practice project implementing task and project management to master React state patterns and component composition.

## 📋 Overview

This practice project demonstrates the implementation of a project management system, focusing on mastering React's state management, component patterns, and data flow through practical coding exercises.

## 🎯 Concepts Being Practiced

### State Management Implementation
- Complex state object with `projectsState` managing projects, tasks, and selection
- Immutable state updates using spread operator
- Event handler implementation with state updates
- Tasks array management with project associations

### Component Structure Practice
- ProjectsSidebar for navigation and project list
- NoProjectSelected for initial/empty state
- SelectedProject for active project view
- NewProject for project creation form
- Task components for task management

### React Patterns in Use
- Conditional rendering based on `selectedProjectId`
- Props passing for component communication
- Event handler implementation and props drilling
- Form handling and input management
- Dynamic list rendering
- Error boundary implementation

## 🎓 Specific Learning Points

### React Features Practiced
- useState with complex objects
- Event handler functions with state updates
- Conditional rendering with multiple states
- Form handling with controlled components
- List rendering with keys
- Props drilling solutions

### Implementation Details
- Task creation with unique IDs
- Project state management
- Delete confirmation handling
- Input validation
- Error state management
- Component lifecycle handling

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
